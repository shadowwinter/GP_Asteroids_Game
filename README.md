# GP_Asteroids_Game
Using p5.js to create a simple HTML Asteroids game clone

To start, run the index.html file.

You are flying a spaceship and have to destroy asteroids before they destroy the Earth (or you!).
Use WASD or arrow keys to move, press space to shoot bullets from your spaceship. Press H for the instructions.

Prevent the asteroids from hitting you or the Earth, and destroy 10 asteroids to win. 
Getting too close to Earth warrants gravitational pull, and pressing F can help boost your spaceship upwards.
